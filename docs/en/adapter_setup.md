## Basic-Setup

1. For the **Basic Setup**, you first need to select a port for the HTTP-server under point 1.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that the selected port is not already being used by another application or process and is not blocked by a firewall.

2. Subsequently, values 2-4 must be entered. How to obtain these values will be described in the following sections.<br>

3. After entering the required data, you can save them by clicking on **'SAVE'**.<br>

4. Next, the adapter needs to be started.<br>
   Immediately after starting, the adapter will attempt to create an HTTP-server that monitors the port specified in step 1 for incoming communication.<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For the successful completion of the following steps, it is essential that the adapter and thus the HTTP-server have been started, and the HTTP-server is capable of monitoring the specified port.

5. Now, authentication can be initiated by clicking the **'Authenticate'** button in the **'Authentication'** section of the Adapter **'Admin Panel'**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To successfully complete the following steps, it is essential that the click on the **'Authenticate'** button is performed in a browser on the same device where ioBroker is installed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **'Authentication'** can only be successfully completed if you are signed in to your browser with the **'Google Account'** associated with your Google (Nest) devices.<br>
> If you are currently not signed in with any **'Google Account'** in your default browser, you will be prompted to sign in with your **'Google Account'** first after clicking the **'Authenticate'** button.<br>
> If, however, you receive an error message after clicking the **'Authenticate'** button, please first check if you are currently signed in with the wrong **'Google Account'**.

6. If you are not already signed in with a **'Google Account'**, please sign in now with the **'Google Account'** associated with your Google (Nest) devices.<br>
   If you are already signed in with the corresponding **'Google Account'**, proceed to the next step.

7. In the next step, you need to grant the adapter permissions to access your Google (Nest) devices.<br>
   To do this, please enable all options and then click the 'Next' button.

> [!NOTE]
> The number of options to be activated here varies based on the number and type of your Google (Nest) devices.
> Accordingly, the screen you see may differ from the screenshot at the top.

> [!TIP]
> Some options may only become available for activation after other options have already been activated.<br>
> Additionally, it may take a short moment for some options to become activatable.

8. In the following step, you may be prompted again to select your **'Google Account'**.<br>
   If prompted, please select the **'Google Account'** associated with your Google (Nest) devices.

9. Now you will be notified that the adapter has not been verified by Google.<br>
   Google requires your consent again here.<br>
   Click the **'Next'** button to proceed.

10. You may now be prompted again to give your consent.

11. If you now receive the message **'*Authorization Code sent to ioBroker successfully. You can close this tab/window now.*'** in your browser, then everything has worked, and the **'Authorization Code'** has been received by the adapter and stored in ioBroker as an object.<br>
    Click on the **'SAVE AND CLOSE'** button in the adapter **'Admin Panel'** to complete the **'Basic-Setup'**.

## Extended-Setup

1. For the **'Extended-Setup'**, you first need to enter the **'Google Cloud - Project-ID'** under point 5.<br>
   If you followed the instructions in the **'Acquiring OAuth-Client-ID & Client Secret'** section, the **'Google Cloud - Project-ID'** was displayed in Step 7 of this section.<br>
   To have the **'Google Cloud - Project-ID'** displayed again, you can use one of the **'Google Cloud Console'** buttons in the adapter **'Admin Panel'** to reopen the **'Google Cloud Console'**.<br>
   Once you have selected your corresponding project in the top left corner of the **'Google Cloud Console'**, the **'Google Cloud - Project-ID'** will be displayed to you on the **'Google Cloud Console'**.

2. To receive (or fetch) events, the **'Pub/Sub-Topic'** must be activated on the Google **'Device Access Console'**.<br>
   If you followed the instructions in the **'Acquiring Project-ID'** section and decided to already activate the events in Step 8 of the section, the **'Pub/Sub-Topic'** should already be activated on the Google **'Device Access Console'**, and you don't need to worry about anything further.<br>
   Otherwise, please follow the **'Activate Pub/Sub-Topic'** section to activate the **'Pub/Sub-Topic'** on the Google **'Device Access Console'**.

3. Afterwards, the checkbox for **'Enable Events'** (point 6) can be checked.

4. Now you can select the **'Events acquisition method'** under point 7.

> [!WARNING]
> Currently, only **'PULL'** is supported as the **'Events acquisition method**'.

5. Under point 8, you can now define the **'Events Pull timeout'** (in seconds).<br>
   This timeout specifies how long the adapter waits after the last event retrieval before it starts retrieving the events of the Google (Nest) devices again.

6. Now click on the **'SAVE AND CLOSE'** button in the adapter **'Admin Panel'** to complete the **'Extended-Setup'**.

## Acquiring **'OAuth-Client-ID'** & **'Client Secret'**

To obtain an **'OAuth-Client-ID'**, you first need to create a Google Cloud project.

1. Open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) in your browser.<br>
> [!TIP]
> The **'Google Cloud Console'** can also be accessed via the address 'https://console.cloud.google.com/' or by clicking on one of the corresponding buttons in the Adapter **'Admin Panel'**.
