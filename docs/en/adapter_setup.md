## Basic-Setup

1. For the **Basic Setup**, you first need to select a port for the HTTP-server under point 1.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that the selected port is not already being used by another application or process and is not blocked by a firewall.

2. Subsequently, values 2-4 must be entered. How to obtain these values will be described in the following sections.<br>

3. After entering the required data, you can save them by clicking on **'SAVE'**.<br>

4. Next, the adapter needs to be started.<br>
   Immediately after starting, the adapter will attempt to create an HTTP-server that monitors the port specified in step 1 for incoming communication.<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For the successful completion of the following steps, it is essential that the adapter and thus the HTTP-server have been started, and the HTTP-server is capable of monitoring the specified port.

5. Now, authentication can be initiated by clicking the **'Authenticate'** button in the **'Authentication'** section of the Adapter **'Admin Panel'**.
