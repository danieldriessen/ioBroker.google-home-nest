## Description

Integrates your Google Home (Nest) devices like Cameras, Doorbells, Displays, Thermostats etc., into the ioBroker system.<br>

You can find more information about the Google Home (Nest) devices here: [Google Home (Nest)](https://store.google.com/de/category/connected_home) and here: [Google Device Access](https://developers.google.com/nest/device-access).<br>

Please be aware that this adapter is currently in development and in beta status. See section "Current development status, limitations & future goals" for more information.<br>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to use this adapter, you must be registered for Google **'Device Access'**.<br>
> Registration for Google **'Device Access'** requires acceptance of the terms of use for the 'Google API' and the 'Device Access Sandbox', as well as a **one-time fee** of **$5 (US dollars)** (as of May 2024).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To receive events from your devices, this adapter creates a **'Pub/Sub subscription'** on the Google platform.<br>
> **'Pub/Sub subscriptions'** on the Google platform can specify a message retention duration. This adapter sets this duration to 600 seconds (10 minutes).<br>
> After this time, unacknowledged messages are automatically deleted by the Google platform.<br>
> Please keep in mind that Google may charge you for message retention beyond this duration.<br>
> The predefined duration of 600 seconds should prevent you from incurring any charges from Google. However, this cannot be guaranteed!<br>
> Please also note that Google may change this policy in the future.<br>
> The developer(s) of this adapter are in no way responsible for any costs that may arise from the use of this adapter!


## Current development status, limitations & future goals

### In its current state of development the adapter (after beeing correctly set up) should be able to...

-   acquire a list of your Google Home (Nest) devices and create an ioBroker device object for each device.
-   retrieve the capabilities of each device, and store them into ioBroker states.
-   acquire events such as 'motion detected', 'doorbell press detected', etc., by regularly pulling data from the Google 'Pub/Sub system'.
    (see section 'Supported devices' for more details about the events implementation status).

### In its current state of development the adapter is NOT capable of...

-   acquiring camera images, preview clips, or live streams.
-   retrieving status updates like 'current ambient temperature', 'current ambient humidity', etc., for devices.
-   sending commands like 'set heat', 'set cool', 'set timer', etc. to the devices.

### Future Goals:

It is intended to implement all of the above-mentioned missing capabilities.
In addition to that, it is also intended to add the possibility to acquire events with a 'PUSH' system.
However, the feasibility of each of these goals is subject to change.
